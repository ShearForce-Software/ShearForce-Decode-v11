= Shear Force Software Team To-Do List:

== Tasks to be worked

- [ ] Create function that can report true/false IF robot is in a legal shooting tile
- [ ] Create an auto shoot mode that can be turned on/off that will shoot if in a legal shooting tile and a ball is loaded
- [ ] AUTO: create an auto that gets and shoots multiple lines in the correct pattern order
- [ ] Create a common blackboard position storage routine in Hardware class, that the auto methods can call after every move, so if crashes on next move, the position is hopefully correct for manual usage
- [ ] Have manual write position to blackboard periodically when in a stopped web-cam verified location?  (So can start and restart manual better)
- [ ] Integrate logic to use the ball distance detection sensor to detect the loaded ball color and change an indicator light to that color
